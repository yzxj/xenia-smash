//!   System timer interrupt handler
//!   - Do a rescheduling operation
//!   - If a context switch occurs within this routine,
//!     - When returning out of process_scheduler, process executing will return in the appropriate
//!       context when it was switched out on a previous flow through this execution path.
//!   - Reset PIT interval to start a full time slice (if PIT in the system) (if INTC not present)
//! @param
//!   - none
//! @return
//!   - nothing
//! @note
//!   - May NOT return from this routine if a NEW process context is scheduled in the scheduler
//!   - A context switch does not occur within this routine if an INTC is present. The switch
//!     occurs at the end of the INTC ISR.
